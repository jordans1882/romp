A binding of the parallel application programming interface OpenMP for the R-Interpreter. Fortran code is generated and compiled on the ï¬‚y by the toolkit and the OpenMP directives are inserted. The toolkit consists of a family of special apply
routines together with reduction routines like sum, mean, product which generate parallel OpenMP code. The toolkit can be used for easy parallelization of parts of an R program
without a steep learning curve for the user.
