#summary R/openMP binding

= Introduction =

== ROMP ==

 * R openMP API 
 * R Syntax to Fortran Converter 
 * Accelerate R code by *compilation*
 * Parallelize R code by *vectorization* 
 * Speedup by _Compilation_: ~100 
 * Speedup by _Vectorization_: ~100 
 * Total Speedup: ~10000


= Summary and Outlook =

 # ROMP scales up to ~100 cores (SMP) 
 # Acceleration up to several 10000 
 # Pre Alpha Version 
 # Combination Rmpi+ROMP? 
 # Extending map/reduce: Use monads? 
 # Type inference aka automatic typing?
